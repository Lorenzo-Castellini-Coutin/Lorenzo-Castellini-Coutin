## Hi! I’m @Lorenzo-Castellini-Coutin 
## About Me!
- Currently, I am a second-year computer engineering student at the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez.
- Also, I am currently part of a research group, where I form part of the back-end portion, which is done using Python, Flask, among other things.
## What I'm Up To
- I’m currently learning more about Python frameworks/libraries, data structures and algorithms, and general C++ terms. 
- Furthermore, I am currently working on three personal projects, two on Python and one on C++, mostly in backend.
## Additional Info
- As of now I am currently looking for interships, research, and/or co-op opportunities.
- In this GitHub, you will find my diverse personal projects, as well as some other projects I might be working on.
